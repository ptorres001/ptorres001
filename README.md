### Thanks for stopping by! 

My name is Paul Torres.

I used to work in Physics with a focus on atmospheric physics research before I turned to focus full time on Data Science. I am interested in telling stories using data. I spend my time learning new topics about machine learning and writing articles on Medium about the techniques that I learn. 

I've written articles on everything from past projects, to algorithm review for further learning, to deep learning concepts like pseudo-supervised learning and I look to continue to learn by doing and passing on that knowledge to the wider community.

As a former research scientist, I've found that exploratory analysis and using the data to build a narrative are the most exciting aspects of data science. 

Projects I am currently working on include:
* Tanzanian Water Pump Hackathon
* Automated text extractor for transferring information from a detailed report to tabular sheet format
* Topic Modeling and Basic NLP Analysis of the Harry Potter Series
