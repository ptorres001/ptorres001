### Thanks for stopping by! 

My name is Paul Torres.

I used to work in Physics with a focus on the atmosphere but I turned to focus full time on Data Science. I am interested in telling stories using data. I spend my time learning new topics about machine learning and writing articles on Medium about the techniques that I learn. 

Projects I am currently working on:
* Tanzanian Water Pump Hackathon
* Automated text extractor for transfering information from detailed report to tabular sheet
* Topic Modeling and Basic Analysis of Harry Potter Series
