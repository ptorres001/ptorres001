### Hi there! 👋

My name is Paul Torres. Thanks for coming by!

I used to work in Physics with a focus on the atmosphere but I turned to focus full time on Data Science. I am interested in telling stories using data.

I am currently working on a deep learning project classifying images. But you can also ask me about any of my finished projects.
